⚠️ DISCLAIMER
Oblivion V1.0 is a educational security tool designed for learning purposes only. This tool should ONLY be used on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized use against systems you don't own is illegal and unethical.

By using this tool, you agree that the developers are not responsible for any misuse.

📖 Overview
Oblivion is a Python-based brute-force simulation tool created by Nishil Bhimani & Riya Mittal to demonstrate password security concepts in a controlled, educational environment. The tool simulates brute-force attacks with built-in defensive mechanisms to teach both offensive and defensive security principles.

🎯 Features
🔐 Core Functionality
Simulated Brute-Force Attacks: Test password strength against generated wordlists

Wordlist Generation: Create custom wordlists with various suffix patterns

Password Strength Checker: Evaluate password security with heuristic scoring

Attempt Logging: Track all login attempts with timestamps

Defensive Simulations: Includes account lockouts and rate limiting

🛡️ Security Features
Automatic account lockout after 5 failed attempts

Configurable lockout duration (default: 30 seconds)

Request throttling (0.5 seconds between attempts)

Comprehensive attempt logging

Educational safety tips and best practices

🚀 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

Required packages: None (uses standard library only)

Clone or download the script:
git clone https://github.com/nishilxy/Brute-Force-by-Nish

Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
chmod +x testbfone.py

Run the tool: python3 testbfone.py

🛡️ Defensive Mechanisms Demonstrated
Account Lockout: Temporary lock after multiple failed attempts

Rate Limiting: Artificial delays between login attempts

Secure Password Storage: Uses SHA-256 hashing (educational)

Comprehensive Logging: All attempts are recorded with timestamps

Security Monitoring: Tools to review and analyze attempt patterns
